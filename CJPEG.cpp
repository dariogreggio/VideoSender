/*
 * About virtual array management:
 *
 * The above "normal" array routines are only used to allocate strip buffers
 * (as wide as the image, but just a few rows high).  Full-image-sized buffers
 * are handled as "virtual" arrays.  The array is still accessed a strip at a
 * time, but the memory manager must save the whole array for repeated
 * accesses.  The intended implementation is that there is a strip buffer in
 * memory (as high as is possible given the desired memory limit), plus a
 * backing file that holds the rest of the array.
 *
 * The request_virt_array routines are told the total size of the image and
 * the maximum number of rows that will be accessed at once.  The in-memory
 * buffer must be at least as large as the maxaccess value.
 *
 * The request routines create control blocks but not the in-memory buffers.
 * That is postponed until realize_virt_arrays is called.  At that time the
 * total amount of space needed is known (approximately, anyway), so free
 * memory can be divided up fairly.
 *
 * The access_virt_array routines are responsible for making a specific strip
 * area accessible (after reading or writing the backing file, if necessary).
 * Note that the access routines are told whether the caller intends to modify
 * the accessed strip; during a read-only pass this saves having to rewrite
 * data to disk.  The access routines are also responsible for pre-zeroing
 * any newly accessed rows, if pre-zeroing was requested.
 *
 * In current usage, the access requests are usually for nonoverlapping
 * strips; that is, successive access start_row numbers differ by exactly
 * num_rows = maxaccess.  This means we can get good performance with simple
 * buffer dump/reload logic, by making the in-memory buffer be a multiple
 * of the access height; then there will never be accesses across bufferload
 * boundaries.  The code will still work with overlapping access requests,
 * but it doesn't handle bufferload overlaps very efficiently.

 * The conversion equations to be implemented are therefore
 *	Y  =  0.29900 * R + 0.58700 * G + 0.11400 * B
 *	Cb = -0.16874 * R - 0.33126 * G + 0.50000 * B  + CENTERJSAMPLE
 *	Cr =  0.50000 * R - 0.41869 * G - 0.08131 * B  + CENTERJSAMPLE
 * (These numbers are derived from TIFF 6.0 section 21, dated 3-June-92.)
 * Note: older versions of the IJG code used a zero offset of MAXJSAMPLE/2,
 * rather than CENTERJSAMPLE, for Cb and Cr.  This gave equal positive and
 * negative swings for Cb/Cr, but meant that grayscale values (Cb=Cr=0)
 * were not represented exactly.  Now we sacrifice exact representation of
 * maximum red and maximum blue in order to get exact grayscales.
 *
 * To avoid floating-point arithmetic, we represent the fractional constants
 * as integers scaled up by 2^16 (about 4 digits precision); we have to divide
 * the products by 2^16, with appropriate rounding, to get the correct answer.
 *
 * For even more speed, we avoid doing any multiplications in the inner loop
 * by precalculating the constants times R,G,B for all possible values.
 * For 8-bit JSAMPLEs this is very reasonable (only 256 entries per table);
 * for 12-bit samples it is still acceptable.  It's not very reasonable for
 * 16-bit samples, but if you want lossless storage you shouldn't be changing
 * colorspace anyway.

/*
 * YCbCr is defined per CCIR 601-1, except that Cb and Cr are
 * normalized to the range 0..MAXJSAMPLE rather than -0.5 .. 0.5.
 * The conversion equations to be implemented are therefore
 *	R = Y                + 1.40200 * Cr
 *	G = Y - 0.34414 * Cb - 0.71414 * Cr
 *	B = Y + 1.77200 * Cb
 * where Cb and Cr represent the incoming values less CENTERJSAMPLE.
 * (These numbers are derived from TIFF 6.0 section 21, dated 3-June-92.)
 *
 * To avoid floating-point arithmetic, we represent the fractional constants
 * as integers scaled up by 2^16 (about 4 digits precision); we have to divide
 * the products by 2^16, with appropriate rounding, to get the correct answer.
 * Notice that Y, being an integral input, does not contribute any fraction
 * so it need not participate in the rounding.
 *
 * For even more speed, we avoid doing any multiplications in the inner loop
 * by precalculating the constants times Cb and Cr for all possible values.
 * For 8-bit JSAMPLEs this is very reasonable (only 256 entries per table);
 * for 12-bit samples it is still acceptable.  It's not very reasonable for
 * 16-bit samples, but if you want lossless storage you shouldn't be changing
 * colorspace anyway.
 * The Cr=>R and Cb=>B values can be rounded to integers in advance; the
 * values for the G calculation are left scaled up, since we must add them
 * together before rounding.

 * Generate the best Huffman code table for the given counts, fill htbl.

 *
 * The JPEG standard requires that no symbol be assigned a codeword of all
 * one bits (so that padding bits added at the end of a compressed segment
 * can't look like a valid code).  Because of the canonical ordering of
 * codewords, this just means that there must be an unused slot in the
 * longest codeword length category.  Section K.2 of the JPEG spec suggests
 * reserving such a slot by pretending that symbol 256 is a valid symbol
 * with count 1.  In theory that's not optimal; giving it count zero but
 * including it in the symbol set anyway should give a better Huffman code.
 * But the theoretically better code actually seems to come out worse in
 * practice, because it produces more all-ones bytes (which incur stuffed
 * zero bytes in the final file).  In any case the difference is tiny.
 *
 * The JPEG standard requires Huffman codes to be no more than 16 bits long.
 * If some symbols have a very small but nonzero probability, the Huffman tree
 * must be adjusted to meet the code length restriction.  We currently use
 * the adjustment method suggested in JPEG section K.2.  This method is *not*
 * optimal; it may not choose the best possible limited-length code.  But
 * typically only very-low-frequency symbols will be given less-than-optimal
 * lengths, so the code is almost optimal.  Experimental comparisons against
 * an optimal limited-length-code algorithm indicate that the difference is
 * microscopic --- usually less than a hundredth of a percent of total size.

/*
 * Several decompression processes need to range-limit values to the range
 * 0..MAXJSAMPLE; the input value may fall somewhat outside this range
 * due to noise introduced by quantization, roundoff error, etc.  These
 * processes are inner loops and need to be as fast as possible.  On most
 * machines, particularly CPUs with pipelines or instruction prefetch,
 * a (subscript-check-less) C table lookup
 *		x = sample_range_limit[x];
 * is faster than explicit tests
 *		if (x < 0)  x = 0;
 *		else if (x > MAXJSAMPLE)  x = MAXJSAMPLE;
 * These processes all use a common table prepared by the routine below.
 *
 * For most steps we can mathematically guarantee that the initial value
 * of x is within MAXJSAMPLE+1 of the legal range, so a table running from
 * -(MAXJSAMPLE+1) to 2*MAXJSAMPLE+1 is sufficient.  But for the initial
 * limiting step (just after the IDCT), a wildly out-of-range value is 
 * possible if the input data is corrupt.  To avoid any chance of indexing
 * off the end of memory and getting a bad-pointer trap, we perform the
 * post-IDCT limiting thus:
 *		x = range_limit[x & MASK];
 * where MASK is 2 bits wider than legal sample data, ie 10 bits for 8-bit
 * samples.  Under normal circumstances this is more than enough range and
 * a correct output will be generated; with bogus input data the mask will
 * cause wraparound, and we will safely generate a bogus-but-in-range output.
 * For the post-IDCT step, we want to convert the data from signed to unsigned
 * representation by adding CENTERJSAMPLE at the same time that we limit it.
 * So the post-IDCT limiting table ends up looking like this:
 *   CENTERJSAMPLE,CENTERJSAMPLE+1,...,MAXJSAMPLE,
 *   MAXJSAMPLE (repeat 2*(MAXJSAMPLE+1)-CENTERJSAMPLE times),
 *   0          (repeat 2*(MAXJSAMPLE+1)-CENTERJSAMPLE times),
 *   0,1,...,CENTERJSAMPLE-1
 * Negative inputs select values from the upper half of the table after
 * masking.
 *
 * We can save some space by overlapping the start of the post-IDCT table
 * with the simpler range limiting table.  The post-IDCT table begins at
 * sample_range_limit + CENTERJSAMPLE.
 *
 * Note that the table is allocated in near data space on PCs; it's small
 * enough and used often enough to justify this.

/*
 * In the current system design, the main buffer need never be a full-image
 * buffer; any full-height buffers will be found inside the coefficient or
 * postprocessing controllers.  Nonetheless, the main controller is not
 * trivial.  Its responsibility is to provide context rows for upsampling/
 * rescaling, and doing this in an efficient fashion is a bit tricky.
 *
 * Postprocessor input data is counted in "row groups".  A row group
 * is defined to be (v_samp_factor * DCT_scaled_size / min_DCT_scaled_size)
 * sample rows of each component.  (We require DCT_scaled_size values to be
 * chosen such that these numbers are integers.  In practice DCT_scaled_size
 * values will likely be powers of two, so we actually have the stronger
 * condition that DCT_scaled_size / min_DCT_scaled_size is an integer.)
 * Upsampling will typically produce max_v_samp_factor pixel rows from each
 * row group (times any additional scale factor that the upsampler is
 * applying).
 *
 * The coefficient controller will deliver data to us one iMCU row at a time;
 * each iMCU row contains v_samp_factor * DCT_scaled_size sample rows, or
 * exactly min_DCT_scaled_size row groups.  (This amount of data corresponds
 * to one row of MCUs when the image is fully interleaved.)  Note that the
 * number of sample rows varies across components, but the number of row
 * groups does not.  Some garbage sample rows may be included in the last iMCU
 * row at the bottom of the image.
 *
 * Depending on the vertical scaling algorithm used, the upsampler may need
 * access to the sample row(s) above and below its current input row group.
 * The upsampler is required to set need_context_rows TRUE at global selection
 * time if so.  When need_context_rows is FALSE, this controller can simply
 * obtain one iMCU row at a time from the coefficient controller and dole it
 * out as row groups to the postprocessor.
 *
 * When need_context_rows is TRUE, this controller guarantees that the buffer
 * passed to postprocessing contains at least one row group's worth of samples
 * above and below the row group(s) being processed.  Note that the context
 * rows "above" the first passed row group appear at negative row offsets in
 * the passed buffer.  At the top and bottom of the image, the required
 * context rows are manufactured by duplicating the first or last real sample
 * row; this avoids having special cases in the upsampling inner loops.
 *
 * The amount of context is fixed at one row group just because that's a
 * convenient number for this controller to work with.  The existing
 * upsamplers really only need one sample row of context.  An upsampler
 * supporting arbitrary output rescaling might wish for more than one row
 * group of context when shrinking the image; tough, we don't handle that.
 * (This is justified by the assumption that downsizing will be handled mostly
 * by adjusting the DCT_scaled_size values, so that the actual scale factor at
 * the upsample step needn't be much less than one.)
 *
 * To provide the desired context, we have to retain the last two row groups
 * of one iMCU row while reading in the next iMCU row.  (The last row group
 * can't be processed until we have another row group for its below-context,
 * and so we have to save the next-to-last group too for its above-context.)
 * We could do this most simply by copying data around in our buffer, but
 * that'd be very slow.  We can avoid copying any data by creating a rather
 * strange pointer structure.  Here's how it works.  We allocate a workspace
 * consisting of M+2 row groups (where M = min_DCT_scaled_size is the number
 * of row groups per iMCU row).  We create two sets of redundant pointers to
 * the workspace.  Labeling the physical row groups 0 to M+1, the synthesized
 * pointer lists look like this:
 *                   M+1                          M-1
 * master pointer --> 0         master pointer --> 0
 *                    1                            1
 *                   ...                          ...
 *                   M-3                          M-3
 *                   M-2                           M
 *                   M-1                          M+1
 *                    M                           M-2
 *                   M+1                          M-1
 *                    0                            0
 * We read alternate iMCU rows using each master pointer; thus the last two
 * row groups of the previous iMCU row remain un-overwritten in the workspace.
 * The pointer lists are set up so that the required context rows appear to
 * be adjacent to the proper places when we pass the pointer lists to the
 * upsampler.
 *
 * The above pictures describe the normal state of the pointer lists.
 * At top and bottom of the image, we diddle the pointer lists to duplicate
 * the first or last sample row as necessary (this is cheaper than copying
 * sample rows around).
 *
 * This scheme breaks down if M < 2, ie, min_DCT_scaled_size is 1.  In that
 * situation each iMCU row provides only one row group so the buffering logic
 * must be different (eg, we must read two iMCU rows before we can emit the
 * first row group).  For now, we simply do not support providing context
 * rows when min_DCT_scaled_size is 1.  That combination seems unlikely to
 * be worth providing --- if someone wants a 1/8th-size preview, they probably
 * want it quick and dirty, so a context-free upsampler is sufficient.

 * Copyright (C) 1991-1996, Thomas G. Lane.
 * This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
 * For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.
 *
 * This file contains downsampling routines.
 *
 * Downsampling input data is counted in "row groups".  A row group
 * is defined to be max_v_samp_factor pixel rows of each component,
 * from which the downsampler produces v_samp_factor sample rows.
 * A single row group is processed in each call to the downsampler module.
 *
 * The downsampler is responsible for edge-expansion of its output data
 * to fill an integral number of DCT blocks horizontally.  The source buffer
 * may be modified if it is helpful for this purpose (the source buffer is
 * allocated wide enough to correspond to the desired output width).
 * The caller (the prep controller) is responsible for vertical padding.
 *
 * The downsampler may request "context rows" by setting need_context_rows
 * during startup.  In this case, the input arrays will contain at least
 * one row group's worth of pixels above and below the passed-in data;
 * the caller will create dummy rows at image top and bottom by replicating
 * the first or last real pixel row.
 *
 * An excellent reference for image resampling is
 *   Digital Image Warping, George Wolberg, 1990.
 *   Pub. by IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA. ISBN 0-8186-8944-7.
 *
 * The downsampling algorithm used here is a simple average of the source
 * pixels covered by the output pixel.  The hi-falutin sampling literature
 * refers to this as a "box filter".  In general the characteristics of a box
 * filter are not very good, but for the specific cases we normally use (1:1
 * and 2:1 ratios) the box is equivalent to a "triangle filter" which is not
 * nearly so bad.  If you intend to use other sampling ratios, you'd be well
 * advised to improve this code.
 *
 * A simple input-smoothing capability is provided.  This is mainly intended
 * for cleaning up color-dithered GIF input files (if you find it inadequate,
 * we suggest using an external filtering program such as pnmconvol).  When
 * enabled, each input pixel P is replaced by a weighted sum of itself and its
 * eight neighbors.  P's weight is 1-8*SF and each neighbor's weight is SF,
 * where SF = (smoothing_factor / 1024).
 * Currently, smoothing is only supported for 2h2v sampling factors.

 * Copyright (C) 1994-1996, Thomas G. Lane.
 * This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
 * For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.
 *
 * This file contains a floating-point implementation of the
 * inverse DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).  In the IJG code, this routine
 * must also perform dequantization of the input coefficients.
 *
 * This implementation should be more accurate than either of the integer
 * IDCT implementations.  However, it may not give the same results on all
 * machines because of differences in roundoff behavior.  Speed will depend
 * on the hardware's floating point capacity.
 *
 * A 2-D IDCT can be done by 1-D IDCT on each column followed by 1-D IDCT
 * on each row (or vice versa, but it's more convenient to emit a row at
 * a time).  Direct algorithms are also available, but they are much more
 * complex and seem not to be any faster when reduced to code.
 *
 * This implementation is based on Arai, Agui, and Nakajima's algorithm for
 * scaled DCT.  Their original paper (Trans. IEICE E-71(11):1095) is in
 * Japanese, but the algorithm is described in the Pennebaker & Mitchell
 * JPEG textbook (see REFERENCES section in file README).  The following code
 * is based directly on figure 4-8 in P&M.
 * While an 8-point DCT cannot be done in less than 11 multiplies, it is
 * possible to arrange the computation so that many of the multiplies are
 * simple scalings of the final outputs.  These multiplies can then be
 * folded into the multiplications or divisions by the JPEG quantization
 * table entries.  The AA&N method leaves only 5 multiplies and 29 adds
 * to be done in the DCT itself.
 * The primary disadvantage of this method is that with a fixed-point
 * implementation, accuracy is lost due to imprecise representation of the
 * scaled quantization values.  However, that problem does not arise if
 * we use floating point arithmetic.

 *
 * Exit: if return TRUE, have read and processed any parameters, and have
 *   updated the restart point to point after the parameters.
 *   If return FALSE, was forced to suspend before reaching end of
 *   marker parameters; restart point has not been moved.  Same routine
 *   will be called again after application supplies more input data.
 *
 * This approach to suspension assumes that all of a marker's parameters can
 * fit into a single input bufferload.  This should hold for "normal"
 * markers.  Some COM/APPn markers might have large parameter segments,
 * but we use skip_input_data to get past those, and thereby put the problem
 * on the source manager's shoulders.
 *
 * Note that we don't bother to avoid duplicate trace messages if a
 * suspension occurs within marker parameters.  Other side effects

 * which permits a more intelligent recovery strategy; such managers would
 * presumably supply their own resync method.
 *
 * read_restart_marker calls resync_to_restart if it finds a marker other than
 * the restart marker it was expecting.  (This code is *not* used unless
 * a nonzero restart interval has been declared.)  cinfo->unread_marker is
 * the marker code actually found (might be anything, except 0 or FF).
 * The desired restart marker number (0..7) is passed as a parameter.
 * This routine is supposed to apply whatever error recovery strategy seems
 * appropriate in order to position the input stream to the next data segment.
 * Note that cinfo->unread_marker is treated as a marker appearing before
 * the current data-source input point; usually it should be reset to zero
 * before returning.
 * Returns FALSE if suspension is required.
 *
 * This implementation is substantially constrained by wanting to treat the
 * input as a data stream; this means we can't back up.  Therefore, we have
 * only the following actions to work with:
 *   1. Simply discard the marker and let the entropy decoder resume at next
 *      byte of file.
 *   2. Read forward until we find another marker, discarding intervening
 *      data.  (In theory we could look ahead within the current bufferload,
 *      without having to discard data if we don't find the desired marker.
 *      This idea is not implemented here, in part because it makes behavior
 *      dependent on buffer size and chance buffer-boundary positions.)
 *   3. Leave the marker unread (by failing to zero cinfo->unread_marker).
 *      This will cause the entropy decoder to process an empty data segment,
 *      inserting dummy zeroes, and then we will reprocess the marker.
 *
 * #2 is appropriate if we think the desired marker lies ahead, while #3 is
 * appropriate if the found marker is a future restart marker (indicating
 * that we have missed the desired restart marker, probably because it got
 * corrupted).
 * We apply #2 or #3 if the found marker is a restart marker no more than
 * two counts behind or ahead of the expected one.  We also apply #2 if the
 * found marker is not a legal JPEG marker code (it's certainly bogus data).
 * If the found marker is a restart marker more than 2 counts away, we do #1
 * (too much risk that the marker is erroneous; with luck we will be able to
 * resync at some future point).
 * For any valid non-restart JPEG marker, we apply #3.  This keeps us from
 * overrunning the end of a scan.  An implementation limited to single-scan
 * files might find it better to apply #2 for markers other than EOI, since
 * any other marker would have to be bogus data in that case.

#ifdef QUANT_1PASS_SUPPORTED


/*
 * The main purpose of 1-pass quantization is to provide a fast, if not very
 * high quality, colormapped output capability.  A 2-pass quantizer usually
 * gives better visual quality; however, for quantized grayscale output this
 * quantizer is perfectly adequate.  Dithering is highly recommended with this
 * quantizer, though you can turn it off if you really want to.
 *
 * In 1-pass quantization the colormap must be chosen in advance of seeing the
 * image.  We use a map consisting of all combinations of Ncolors[i] color
 * values for the i'th component.  The Ncolors[] values are chosen so that
 * their product, the total number of colors, is no more than that requested.
 * (In most cases, the product will be somewhat less.)
 *
 * Since the colormap is orthogonal, the representative value for each color
 * component can be determined without considering the other components;
 * then these indexes can be combined into a colormap index by a standard
 * N-dimensional-array-subscript calculation.  Most of the arithmetic involved
 * can be precalculated and stored in the lookup table colorindex[].
 * colorindex[i][j] maps pixel value j in component i to the nearest
 * representative value (grid plane) for that component; this index is
 * multiplied by the array stride for component i, so that the
 * index of the colormap entry closest to a given pixel value is just
 *    sum( colorindex[component-number][pixel-component-value] )
 * Aside from being fast, this scheme allows for variable spacing between
 * representative values with no additional lookup cost.
 *
 * If gamma correction has been applied in color conversion, it might be wise
 * to adjust the color grid spacing so that the representative colors are
 * equidistant in linear space.  At this writing, gamma correction is not
 * implemented by jdcolor, so nothing is done here.
 */


/* Declarations for ordered dithering.
 *
 * We use a standard 16x16 ordered dither array.  The basic concept of ordered
 * dithering is described in many references, for instance Dale Schumacher's
 * chapter II.2 of Graphics Gems II (James Arvo, ed. Academic Press, 1991).
 * In place of Schumacher's comparisons against a "threshold" value, we add a
 * "dither" value to the input pixel and then round the result to the nearest
 * output value.  The dither value is equivalent to (0.5 - threshold) times
 * the distance between output values.  For ordered dithering, we assume that
 * the output colors are equally spaced; if not, results will probably be
 * worse, since the dither may be too much or too little at a given point.
 *
 * The normal calculation would be to form pixel value + dither, range-limit
 * this to 0..MAXJSAMPLE, and then index into the colorindex table as usual.
 * We can skip the separate range-limiting step by extending the colorindex
 * table in both directions.

/*
 * This module implements the well-known Heckbert paradigm for color
 * quantization.  Most of the ideas used here can be traced back to
 * Heckbert's seminal paper
 *   Heckbert, Paul.  "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display",
 *   Proc. SIGGRAPH '82, Computer Graphics v.16 #3 (July 1982), pp 297-304.
 *
 * In the first pass over the image, we accumulate a histogram showing the
 * usage count of each possible color.  To keep the histogram to a reasonable
 * size, we reduce the precision of the input; typical practice is to retain
 * 5 or 6 bits per color, so that 8 or 4 different input values are counted
 * in the same histogram cell.
 *
 * Next, the color-selection step begins with a box representing the whole
 * color space, and repeatedly splits the "largest" remaining box until we
 * have as many boxes as desired colors.  Then the mean color in each
 * remaining box becomes one of the possible output colors.
 * 
 * The second pass over the image maps each input pixel to the closest output
 * color (optionally after applying a Floyd-Steinberg dithering correction).
 * This mapping is logically trivial, but making it go fast enough requires
 * considerable care.
 *
 * Heckbert-style quantizers vary a good deal in their policies for choosing
 * the "largest" box and deciding where to cut it.  The particular policies
 * used here have proved out well in experimental comparisons, but better ones
 * may yet be found.
 *
 * In earlier versions of the IJG code, this module quantized in YCbCr color
 * space, processing the raw upsampled data without a color conversion step.
 * This allowed the color conversion math to be done only once per colormap
 * entry, not once per pixel.  However, that optimization precluded other
 * useful optimizations (such as merging color conversion with upsampling)
 * and it also interfered with desired capabilities such as quantizing to an
 * externally-supplied colormap.  We have therefore abandoned that approach.
 * The present code works in the post-conversion color space, typically RGB.
 *
 * To improve the visual quality of the results, we actually work in scaled
 * RGB space, giving G distances more weight than R, and R in turn more than
 * B.  To do everything in integer math, we must use integer scale factors.
 * The 2/3/1 scale factors used here correspond loosely to the relative
 * weights of the colors in the NTSC grayscale equation.
 * If you want to use this code to quantize a non-RGB color space, you'll
 * probably need to change these scale factors.
 */

 * you'll get compile errors until you extend this logic.  In that case

/*
 * These routines are concerned with the time-critical task of mapping input
 * colors to the nearest color in the selected colormap.
 *
 * We re-use the histogram space as an "inverse color map", essentially a
 * cache for the results of nearest-color searches.  All colors within a
 * histogram cell will be mapped to the same colormap entry, namely the one
 * closest to the cell's center.  This may not be quite the closest entry to
 * the actual input color, but it's almost as good.  A zero in the cache
 * indicates we haven't found the nearest color for that cell yet; the array
 * is cleared to zeroes before starting the mapping pass.  When we find the
 * nearest color for a cell, its colormap index plus one is recorded in the
 * cache for future use.  The pass2 scanning routines call fill_inverse_cmap
 * when they need to use an unfilled entry in the cache.
 *
 * Our method of efficiently finding nearest colors is based on the "locally
 * sorted search" idea described by Heckbert and on the incremental distance
 * calculation described by Spencer W. Thomas in chapter III.1 of Graphics
 * Gems II (James Arvo, ed.  Academic Press, 1991).  Thomas points out that
 * the distances from a given colormap entry to each cell of the histogram can
 * be computed quickly using an incremental method: the differences between
 * distances to adjacent cells themselves differ by a constant.  This allows a
 * fairly fast implementation of the "brute force" approach of computing the
 * distance from every colormap entry to every histogram cell.  Unfortunately,
 * it needs a work array to hold the best-distance-so-far for each histogram
 * cell (because the inner loop has to be over cells, not colormap entries).
 * The work array elements have to be INT32s, so the work array would need
 * 256Kb at our recommended precision.  This is not feasible in DOS machines.
 *
 * To get around these problems, we apply Thomas' method to compute the
 * nearest colors for only the cells within a small subbox of the histogram.
 * The work array need be only as big as the subbox, so the memory usage
 * problem is solved.  Furthermore, we need not fill subboxes that are never
 * referenced in pass2; many images use only part of the color gamut, so a
 * fair amount of work is saved.  An additional advantage of this
 * approach is that we can apply Heckbert's locality criterion to quickly
 * eliminate colormap entries that are far away from the subbox; typically
 * three-fourths of the colormap entries are rejected by Heckbert's criterion,
 * and we need not compute their distances to individual cells in the subbox.
 * The speed of this approach is heavily influenced by the subbox size: too
 * small means too much overhead, too big loses because Heckbert's criterion
 * can't eliminate as many colormap entries.  Empirically the best subbox
 * size seems to be about 1/512th of the histogram (1/8th in each direction).
 *
 * Thomas' article also describes a refined method which is asymptotically
 * faster than the brute-force method, but it is also far more complex and
 * cannot efficiently be applied to small subboxes.  It is therefore not
 * useful for programs intended to be portable to DOS machines.  On machines
 * with plenty of memory, filling the whole histogram in one shot with Thomas'
 * refined method might be faster than the present code --- but then again,
 * it might not be any faster, and it's certainly more complicated.

 * SOME FINE POINTS:

 * with this because we were only relying on the value of cinfo.next_scanline,
 * which will be incremented correctly.  If you maintain additional loop
 * variables then you should be careful to increment them properly.
 * Actually, for output to a stdio stream you needn't worry, because
 * then jpeg_write_scanlines will write all the lines passed (or else exit
 * with a fatal error).  Partial writes can only occur if you use a data
 * destination module that can demand suspension of the compressor.
 * (If you don't know what that's for, you don't need it.)
 *
 * If the compressor requires full-image buffers (for entropy-coding
 * optimization or a multi-scan JPEG file), it will create temporary
 * files for anything that doesn't fit within the maximum-memory setting.
 * (Note that temp files are NOT needed if you use the default parameters.)
 * On some systems you may need to set up a signal handler to ensure that
 * temporary files are deleted if the program is interrupted.  See libjpeg.doc.
 *
 * Scanlines MUST be supplied in top-to-bottom order if you want your JPEG
 * files to be compatible with everyone else's.  If you cannot readily read
 * your data in that order, you'll need an intermediate array to hold the
 * image.  See rdtarga.c or rdbmp.c for examples of handling bottom-to-top
 * source data using the JPEG code's internal virtual-array mechanisms.
