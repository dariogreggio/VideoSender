### General Notes

* for some source-doc read [ReadMe.txt](./ReadMe.txt)
* copy Access DB .mdb from /db to binary source directory

### Initial Software to get the project going

- Plug in your camera first
- Since .exe - runs on Windows
- Create an ODBC entry in your system called "vidsendMDB"
- Install **Indeo** decrompressor (atm default, though would work with other)
- then start "vidsend.exe" - create server/create client



- In theory you can run as many clients to server as you want; only limitation is your computer hardware and bandwidth
- Atm all in italian language, but we are working on it.

#### Notes

* We have also made successful tests with Xvid. You can find some binaries on [their website](https://www.xvid.com/download/)
