    Function name: ExtractNalUnit

        Functional description:
            Extracts one NAL unit from the byte stream buffer. Removes
            emulation prevention bytes if present. The original stream buffer
            is used directly and is therefore modified if emulation prevention
            bytes are present in the stream.

            Stream buffer is assumed to contain either exactly one NAL unit
            and nothing else, or one or more NAL units embedded in byte
            stream format described in the Annex B of the standard. Function
            detects which one is used based on the first bytes in the buffer.

        Inputs:
            pByteStream     pointer to byte stream buffer
            len             length of the stream buffer (in bytes)

        Outputs:
            pStrmData       stream information is stored here
            readBytes       number of bytes "consumed" from the stream buffer

        Returns:
            HANTRO_OK       success
            HANTRO_NOK      error in byte stream

/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Function name: h264bsdConceal

        Functional description:
            Perform error concealment for a picture. Two types of concealment
            is performed based on sliceType:
                1) copy from previous picture for P-slices.
                2) concealment from neighbour pixels for I-slices

            I-type concealment is based on ideas presented by Jarno Tulkki.
            The concealment algorithm determines frequency domain coefficients
            from the neighbour pixels, applies integer transform (the same
            transform used in the residual processing) and uses the results as
            pixel values for concealed macroblocks. Transform produces 4x4
            array and one pixel value has to be used for 4x4 luma blocks and
            2x2 chroma blocks.

            Similar concealment is performed for whole picture (the choise
            of the type is based on last successfully decoded slice header of
            the picture but it is handled by the calling function). It is
            acknowledged that this may result in wrong type of concealment
            when a picture contains both types of slices. However,
            determination of slice type macroblock-by-macroblock cannot
            be done due to the fact that it is impossible to know to which
            slice each corrupted (not successfully decoded) macroblock
            belongs.

            The error concealment is started by searching the first propoerly
            decoded macroblock and concealing the row containing the macroblock
            in question. After that all macroblocks above the row in question
            are concealed. Finally concealment of rows below is performed.
            The order of concealment for 4x4 picture where macroblock 9 is the
            first properly decoded one is as follows (properly decoded
            macroblocks marked with 'x', numbers indicating the order of
            concealment):

               4  6  8 10
               3  5  7  9
               1  x  x  2
              11 12 13 14

            If all macroblocks of the picture are lost, the concealment is
            copy of previous picture for P-type and setting the image to
            constant gray (pixel value 128) for I-type.

            Concealment sets quantization parameter of the concealed
            macroblocks to value 40 and macroblock type to intra to enable
            deblocking filter to smooth the edges of the concealed areas.

        Inputs:
            pStorage        pointer to storage structure
            currImage       pointer to current image structure
            sliceType       type of the slice

        Outputs:
            currImage       concealed macroblocks will be written here

        Returns:
            HANTRO_OK

          Perform deblocking filtering for a picture. Filter does not copy

          on the original image. Parameters controlling the filtering process
          are computed based on information in macroblock structures of the
          filtered macroblock, macroblock above and macroblock on the left of
          the filtered one.

        Inputs:
          image         pointer to image to be filtered
          mb            pointer to macroblock data structure of the top-left
                        macroblock of the picture

            tasks like

                * decode parameter sets

                * conceal errors in the picture
                * perform deblocking filtering

            This function contains top level control logic of the decoder.

                            application

    Function name: h264bsdDecodePicParamSet

        Functional description:
            Decode picture parameter set information from the stream.

            Function allocates memory for
                - run lengths if slice group map type is 0
                - top-left and bottom-right arrays if map type is 2
                - for slice group ids if map type is 6

            Validity of some of the slice group mapping information depends
            on the image dimensions which are not known here. Therefore the
            validity has to be checked afterwards, currently in the parameter
            set activation phase.

        Inputs:
            pStrmData       pointer to stream data structure

        Outputs:
            pPicParamSet    decoded information is stored here

        Returns:
            HANTRO_OK       success
            HANTRO_NOK      failure, invalid information or end of stream
            MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ERROR for memory allocation failure

   5.4  Function: h264bsdDecodeExpGolombTruncated

        Functional description:
            Decode truncated Exp-Golomb code. greaterThanOne flag indicates
            the range of the symbol to be decoded as follows:
                FALSE   ->  [0,1]
                TRUE    ->  [0,2^32-1]

            If flag is false the decoding is performed by reading one bit
            from the stream with h264bsdGetBits and mapping this to decoded
            symbol as
                symbol = bit ? 0 : 1

            Otherwise, i.e. when flag is TRUE, code num is determined by
            h264bsdDecodeExpGolombUnsigned and this is used as the decoded
            symbol.
